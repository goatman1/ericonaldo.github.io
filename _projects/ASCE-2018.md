* Designed the bridge painting based on Sichuan face changing opera, which showed bold innovation with extremely contrasting and dramatic colors and thus got our bridge design the first place in display;
* Designed the Pratt truss and original fishâ€“bellied beams to reduce the cost and weight of the structure and ease the constructability of the structure, which got our bridge design the third place in terms of lightness;
* Self-learned cutting, welding, polishing, etc., and constructed the steel bridge with teammates;
* Optimized the assembly sequence and staffing to shorten the assembly time, which significantly contributed to our fifth ranking in the final MIDPAC competition.
